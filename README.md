## The module
The custom_poling module can be used to design the domain configuration of a nonlinear crystal to approximate a desired phase-matching function. 

## For users

### Installation instructions
0. Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (and optionally [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)) installed.
1. Open terminal.

    1.5 (Optional) It can be useful to create a new environment (here called `my_env`) and install Python 3.8 (recommended). Within terminal:
    ```
    conda create -n my_env python=3.8 
    ```
    then
    ```
    conda activate my_env
    ```
2. Within the terminal,  clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abranczyk/custom-poling.git
```
3. Change directory to the freshly cloned custom-poling module:
```bash
cd custom-poling
```
4. Install the package (this step gives you access to the module _outside_ of the cloned directory):
```bash
pip install -e .
```
5. You can now use the package. 

### How to use installed the package

Now that you have the package installed, you can:
- follow the examples within the tutorial notebooks, or
- see the example in `example.py` (you can execute it within the terminal using `python example.py`), or
- write your own python code in a notebook or `.py` file.

### How to contribute

1. To make a contribution, first set up a remote branch (here called `my-contribution`) that is tracked:
```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b my-contribution
```
... make your contribution now (edit some code, add some files) ...
```
git add .
git commit -m 'initial working version of my contribution'
git push -u origin my-contribution
```
2. Before making a Pull Request always get the latest changes from master:
```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout my-contribution
git merge master
```
... fix any merge conflicts here ...
```
git add .
git commit -m 'merged updates from master'
git push
```
3. Go back to the `/custom-poling` repo on _GitHub_, switch to your contribution branch (same name: `my-contribution`), and click "Pull Request". Write a clear explanation of the feature.
4. Under Reviewer, select Agata Branczyk.
5. Click "Create Pull Request".
6. Your Pull Request will be reviewed and, if everything is ok, it will be merged.
